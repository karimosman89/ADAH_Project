Sample data consists of 147 nii.gz-files (zipped nii-files)
ADHD patients are named areg_ADHD_123, 
healthy control group areg_hCon_123

To have a look at nii.gz e.g. download MRICron under https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron/

the data has been skull-stripped, affine registered (hence the areg_) to the MNI template and underwent thourough quality control



in the csv-file age and sex of the patients/hCon are documented
